## Motif SpeedWriter

*"It should be fast..."*

This is an exploration of just how quickly and easily we can create [Motif Notation](http://www.lodc.org/about-us/what-is-language-of-dance/motif-notation.html) graphics. Motif is a graphical notation for scribing human movement and is one component of [Laban Movement Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_Movement_Analysis).

### History

The project began with musing about whether it might be possible to create a horizontal Motif text format using only the letters, numbers, and symbols found on a keyboard. This Motif Text Notation, while obviously lacking the beauty and universality of symbolic [Motif Notation](http://www.lodc.org/about-us/what-is-language-of-dance/motif-notation.html), would be fast to input and might at least suffice in enough situations as to be worth developing.

But if one could enter simple Motifs purely from the keyboard, then those Motifs should be easily parsable by a computer program and turned into graphical Motifs on the page, which could then be downloaded.

And so this project was born.

### Your Turn

Try it out by simply loading the index.html page in a browser. Enter text modeled after the examples, and see what you think. At the moment, only a handful of terms are available, but hopefully enough to get a feel for it. It may seem blasphemous to use letters and numbers instead of the rich symbology of [Motif Notation](http://www.lodc.org/about-us/what-is-language-of-dance/motif-notation.html), and certainly this current experiment is based on English-language Laban terms. But my hope is that it will inspire us to get curious about how we might approach old challenges in new ways, as we continue to promote movement literacy to the masses.

Feel free to use the generated Motif images wherever and however you want. If you remove the small watermark at the bottom, please provide attribution or a link back to [LabanLabs.org](http://www.labanlabs.org) in some other way. Enjoy!
